# Data Structures
This repository covers a variety of topics related to data structures.


## LRU Cache
Design a Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache. An LRU cache is a type of cache in which we remove the least recently used entry when the cache memory reaches its limit.

## File Recursion
Code that finds all files under a directory (and all directories beneath it) that end with ".c".


## Huffman Coding
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. 

## Active Directory
In Windows Active Directory, a group can consist of user(s) and group(s) themselves. We can construct this hierarchy as such. Where User is represented by str representing their ids.

## Blockchain
A Blockchain is a sequential chain of records, similar to a linked list. Each block contains some information and how it is connected related to the other blocks in the chain. Each block contains a pointer to the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. For our blockchain we will be using a SHA-256 hash, the Greenwich Mean Time when the block was created, and text strings as the data.

## Union and Intersection
The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A âˆ© B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B.
